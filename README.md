## Algorithms:
1. DMPO (Our method)
2. DPPO (Decentralized PPO)
4. CPPO (Centralized PPO)
3. IA2C
5. IC3Net

* radius and radius_q: 
    * The observable radius of p should be 1.
    * The V of each agent predicts the local reward.
    
## Environments:
CACC Catchup, Slowdown.
Ring Attenuation.
Figure Eight.


## Interface:
The state, reward, done should all be numpy arrays.
For MARL, done should be given for each agent, although we assume they are the same.

## Environment setup
1. SUMO installation

The commit number of SUMO, available at https://github.com/eclipse/sumo used to run the results is 2147d155b1.
To install SUMO, you are recommended to refer to https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/Linux_Build.html to install the specific version via repository checkout. Note that the latest version of SUMO is not compatible with Flow environments.
In brief, after you checkout to that version, run the following command to build the SUMO binaries.
```
sudo apt-get install cmake python g++ libxerces-c-dev libfox-1.6-dev libgdal-dev libproj-dev libgl2ps-dev swig
cd <sumo_dir> # please insert the correct directory name here
export SUMO_HOME="$PWD"
mkdir build/cmake-build && cd build/cmake-build
cmake ../..
make -j$(nproc)
```

2. Setting up the environment.

It's recommended to set up the environment via Anaconda. The environment specification is in environment.yml.
After installing the required packages, run
```
export PYTHONPATH="$SUMO_HOME/tools:$PYTHONPATH"
```
in terminal to include the SUMO python packages.

3. Setting up WandB.

Our code uses WandB as logger. Before running our code, you should log in to WandB locally. Please refer to https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart for more detail.

## Usage
```python
python launcher.py --env ENV --algo ALGO --name NAME --para PARA
```
`ENV` specifies which environment to run in, including `eight`, `ring`, `catchup`ï¼Œ `slowdown`.
`ALGO` specifies the algorithm to use, including `IA2C`, `IC3Net`, `CPPO`, `DPPO`, `DMPO`.
`NAME` is the additional name for the logger, which is set to `''` as default.
`PARA` is the hyperparameter json string. The default parameters are loaded from config folder, and this would override specific parameters.
